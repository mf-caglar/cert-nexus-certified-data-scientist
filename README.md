# cert-nexus-certified-data-scientist
* This is the project completed through Certnexus Data Science Practitioner professional certificate program on Coursera.
* We aim to analyze and process data stored in the company database and create three machine learning models to predict customer churn and spending and create a customer segmentation for business decisions in the future
* For me, this project differs in terms of the design of the course. It was not heavily supervised like many others and it shows me that there is a terrific mathematical realm behind all the machine learning processes full of statistics and linear algebra. Coding is also very important but after math is done
